== Beta Testers Needed ==

I really want GC Testimonials to Testimonials and GC Testimonials to Testimonials Premium to be the best WordPress plugins of their type. However, it's beyond me to do it alone.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of GC Testimonials to Testimonials and GC Testimonials to Testimonials Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

[Please contact me directly](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/).

Beta testers benefit directly with latest versions, a free unlimited sites license for GC Testimonials to Testimonials Premium, and personalized support assistance.
